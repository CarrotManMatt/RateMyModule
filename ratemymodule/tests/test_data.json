            "Loved this module :)",
            "Teaching (3/5): The teaching was average. Concepts were explained adequately, but there was room for improvement in making complex ideas more accessible. Assessment (3/5): The assessments were fair, aligning with the taught material. However, a bit more variety in assessment types could have made the module more interesting. Overall Enjoyment (2/5): While the subject matter was intriguing, the delivery could have been more engaging. The lack of interactive elements made the overall experience less enjoyable. Difficulty (3/5): The difficulty level was moderate. Some topics were challenging, but with more interactive sessions, it could have been more manageable. In summary, the Functional Programming module was satisfactory, but improvements in teaching methods and overall engagement could enhance the learning experience.",
            "The Data Structures and Algorithms module was decent, with about a 7/10 energy level. The content was presented adequately, and the assessments were fair. I felt it could have been more engaging, but it wasn't a bad experience overall.",
            "I found the Data Structures and Algorithms module to be challenging and somewhat disorganized. The lectures were dense, making it difficult to follow the material, and the assessments felt disproportionately difficult compared to the provided resources. More clarity in the course structure and additional support for understanding complex algorithms would have greatly improved the learning experience.",
            "I recently completed the first-year university module on Data Structures and Algorithms, and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences.Overall, I found the course to be extremely valuable and essential for any computer science student. The module provided a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of organizing and manipulating data, as well as the algorithms used for efficient problem-solving.One of the strengths of the course was its clear structure. The topics were presented in a logical progression, starting with the basics of data structures such as arrays and linked lists and gradually advancing to more complex structures like trees and graphs. The gradual complexity allowed me to build a solid foundation before delving into more intricate concepts."
